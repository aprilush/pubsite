tool to generate interlinked and rdfa annotated html5 webpages taking as input one or more bibtex files

main reason for this is to leanr the tools
- write it in python to learn the language - i'm aware there are libraries that already do parts of this
- use html5 to learn that too  

second stage - implement something like sclippy to extract more info from the lod cloud
